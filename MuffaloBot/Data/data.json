    "!cleanslate": "When developing new mods, please make sure you're using the minimum possible mod list, preferably only direct dependencies for your mod. This not only cuts down on load times but minimizes the chances that edge case incompatibilities make it difficult to understand whether you did something wrong or your mod is being broken by an outside mod. Definitely do not use performance mods like Performance Analyzer until you are feature-complete and profiling for performance.\n\nAlso, it's a good idea to ensure that you have a clean error log at all times. Whether you ignore errors or not as a player is your prerogative, but ignoring errors while developing mods is a fast ticket to sanity loss. Make sure you have no errors before you start developing, address errors immediately when they pop up, and work your error list from top to bottom as later errors tend to be collateral damage from an earlier failure.",
